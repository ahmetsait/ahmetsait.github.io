# About this blog
Here you will *(hopefully)* find blog posts about many different topics ranging from game development to microcontroller
programming, image processing to language design, graphics programming to data serialization, metaprogramming to machine
learning, anything and everything in between computer science with occasional rants of pure rage.

I will be posting *(again, hopefully)* about my projects, interesting problems I may have solved, cool concepts, designs
and technical stuff I do in general.

This website is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with a handcrafted template and custom theme to be served
on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). You can check out the original
[repo](https://github.com/ahmetsait/ahmetsait.github.io) if you wish to do so.

As you may have noticed, I built the website to support both English and Turkish but since I'm handwriting the
translations myself there is no guarantee that the content will be the same for both, which means you might not be able
to find the English equivalent of a Turkish post or vice versa. To change the current language you can use the
<i class="fas fa-earth-americas"></i> icon at the top-right corner.

# About me
<img class="noselect" style="width:100px;height:134.30630604px;float:right" src="{{ 'assets/profile.svg' | relative_url }}"

I'm a passionate software developer from Turkey with interest in many things, most notably computer graphics and
language design. I'm a pretty seasoned C# developer and a [D language](https://dlang.org) enthusiast with an ever
growing list of ideas and things to do.

You will see me developing and contributing to open source projects or if I'm not doing that I'm probably coding my next
great game idea in my basement that will likely never see the light of day.

## Hiring?
Looking for developer equivalent of a Swiss army knife? Need a fast learning junior with the experience of a senior?
