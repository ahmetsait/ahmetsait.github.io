## About this blog
Here you will *(hopefully)* find blog posts about many different topics ranging from game development to microcontroller
programming, image processing to language design, graphics programming to data serialization, metaprogramming to
machine learning, anything and everything in between computer science with occasional rants of pure rage.

I will be posting *(again, hopefully)* about my projects, interesting problems I may have solved, cool language concepts
and technical stuff I do in general.

This website is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with a handcrafted template and custom theme to be served
on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). You can check out the original
[repo](https://github.com/ahmetsait/ahmetsait.github.io) if you wish to do so.

I'm a passionate software developer from Turkey with interest in many things, most notably computer graphics and
language design. I'm a pretty seasoned C# developer and a [D language](https://dlang.org) enthusiast with an ever
growing list of ideas and things to do.

You will see me developing and contributing to open source projects or if I'm not doing that I'm probably coding my next
great game idea in my basement that will likely never see the light of day.

### Hiring?
