Testing 1, 2... We good? Alright so I've been thinking about writing a blog post for quite some time now and it seems
given the situation we're in these days *\*cough\*corona\*cough\** I decided to finally do it instead of sitting
unproductive at home, yay! Besides, my list of blog post ideas kept growing thus I knew I had to eventually do something
about that.

Usually the next step that comes after deciding to _do_ something is _how_ to do it. Being a perfectionist control
freak that I am, I knew things like WordPress wouldn't cut it for me, except there was this tiny little problem: I had
virtually no web tech experience. Therefore setting up my own host or domain seemed too much of a hassle. Having seen
quite some neat websites on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and the fact that it allows total control of the
content being hosted made the decision process short lived. Also it would be practically zero cost if I somehow failed
miserably.

At first it all seemed so easy, you just write a post in markdown and push it! And in fact, it actually *is* that
simple, except my NIH syndrome kicked in. You see, I could just use one of the premade
[templates](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme) or fork [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and
be up and running in no time. Then maybe I could tweak little things if need be. But what's the challenge in that?!
Instead I said to myself *"well then, maybe the time has come"*.

*[NIH]: Not Invented Here

Thus, I decided to write my own template with custom styling and all that while simultaneously learning HTML & CSS in
the process. Surely it can't be that bad? After all, I will likely not even write any javascript code and establish a
breach between this world and the dread realm of corrupt entities. Oh boy I was wrong. The force of HTML and CSS
together in the same conceptual space have destroyed my mind like so much watery putty[^1].

*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets

I could go on to great lengths at how much web technologies disgust me but that deserves its own blog post. Long story
short I managed to make a pretty neat looking website in ~1 week and learned how a lot of things work (and how they
don't).

Enjoy!
